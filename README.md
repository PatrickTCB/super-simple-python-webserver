# Super Simple Python Webserver
This is a simple python webserver. It's meant to be expanded upon with program logic, security features and whatever else your project will need.

When I have need a simple website, I always start with this as my template.

Just update the `build.sh` and `run.sh` scripts with your docker container registry and you're ready to start testing.
